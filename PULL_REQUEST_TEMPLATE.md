When submitting a PR, ensure that you mention the following:  

* What issue you are fixing, or what feature you are adding.
* If you are fixing an issue present in the Issues tab, clearly mention the issue number.
* A screenshot is useful--PRs without screenshots are slower to process.

Further, it is recommended that you create a branch and then start a PR--if there is a problem with your PR, and you started it to `master`, it will be rejected. PRs to a branch will be accepted if the errors are minor.
